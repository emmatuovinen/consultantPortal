                The Consultant app aims to ease the process of matching client engagements with available consultants. Consultant app works as a supportive tool to connect available Academy consultants and Academic work sales.

The app enables the sales personnel to post open client positions, from which the consultants get all the needed information to succeed in the interview. This includes information about the firm, position and needs, technologies requirements, and other relevant information. The consultants are also able to address their interest for open positions to ease the sales process on finding good matches for the assignment.
